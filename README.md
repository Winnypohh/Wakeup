# Text Adventure Game "Wake up!!!"

[Wakeup game](https://myfirstapptextadventure.herokuapp.com/)

For my Portfolio Project 3 I made a simple text based game. It,s runs on Python. 
Game where you need to follow a interesting story and
answer the question. Game has a age group 18 and over to add some extra. 
It's a interesting to read and follow the flow of the game.
Story is scary and but easy to make you get to the end easy if you read all the story from the start.

# HOW TO PLAY.

## First you need to: Run Program.

Next you need to add your name and age if you under age you can't play.
If you are over 18 it will let you play the game.
Game starts with text how the day started in the game.
Every end of the text has a Question.
Question is simple, correct full answer of (yes or no, left or right ...).
 Any wrong answer takes you back to start.
If you make a spelling mistake on answer you need to start game again.

# Future features.

Player collects and store something for later ( key, coyne...) 
Disain back ground and make every text in new page.
Make some background sounds like door opens or sound of fire.
